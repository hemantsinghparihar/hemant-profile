                         Women are more risk-averse when it comes to participating in negotiation events and research shows women actually negotiate less often than men across a variety of situations. This tendency perpetuates inequality such as the disparities in leadership and wage gap between men and women. We conducted qualitative research on women's experiences, feelings, and knowledge of negotiation and found that women regard negotiation skills as valuable and pertinent to a wide variety of contexts but don't know how to use them. Something is missing. How can we use HCI strategies to close the knowledge and confidence gap women experience when negotiating?
